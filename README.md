## Free Maths Problems

`Knowledge is of no value unless you put it to practice

In most mathematics examinations, the problems which carry the most weight/marks are traditionally word problems or problems involving the application of mathematics to a particular scenario. Yet, these problems are also the hardest to prepare for, since similar word problems can be significantly more difficult to identify. Changing irrelavant details in the problem can make mathematically identitcal problems seem completely different at first glance. The purpose of this web application is to provide a source of word problems in high-school mathematics which generates problems from pre-defined 'problem types' while artifically varying irrelevant details such as names, dates, activities, and specific numbers. This will allow the user to practice identifying various problem types and improve their word problem skills.

Users are prompted to enter a list of topics and the desired number of questions from each topic. Then, two pdf files are generated using pdfMake, one containing the problems, and the other the solutions. 

This repository forms the backend of the application and is deployed using Heroku. The frontend can be found here: https://github.com/AodenTeo/problems.git
